This is all the commands you use in git shell (windows) or terminal (mac and linux) (the important ones)

git pull - to update your game  , should do before you even do a commit
git push - to push your commits to the branch your on
git commit -a -m 'put commit message here' - to commit changes
git checkout BranchName - to checkout to a certain branch (needs the full name to work ) 
git checkout -b BranchName - same as before except you create a new branch

have any questions? be sure to ask MGRacer48 for answers to github questions :)
