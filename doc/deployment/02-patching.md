Client Deployment Preparation
========================
The second and last step in building a distributable Toontown Journey client is preparing the distribution and all of its files. There are three steps to doing this:

* **Patching the client**
* [Writing the distribution files](03-writing.md)
* [Uploading the distribution with FTP](04-uploading.md)

This document outlines how to accomplish the first task.

Patching the client is quite simple when using the write_patcher.py utility. It will patch all of the files and write patcher.xml for you. deploy.json lists all of the files that get patched.

# Usage
There is no usage to patching the client. deploy.py will patch the client for you.
