    This is the "main" class that powers the Toontown Rewritten launcher. It manages
    everything the launcher needs to do, including manage all the "sub-threads" that
    carry out tasks such as patching.

    As of right now, the launcher consists of 3 threads:

        - "main-thread": This is the thread which holds this class, and keeps everything
        running properly. This also manages state transitions as well as submitting
        data to and from the web server.

        - "graphical": This thread will hold the GUI side of the launcher, such as abs
        wyPython interface. Usually, this is what the end user will see when running the
        launcher.

        - "patcher": Since the majority of the patching process is locking, it has to be
        run on a separate thread to keep the main thread alive. This thread will deal with
        all the files it needs to download, as well as update/patch. During the download
        process, the patcher will also report back the current download percentage of the
        current file it is downloading.
